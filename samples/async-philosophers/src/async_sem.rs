//! Async Semaphore based demo
//!
//! This implementation on the dining philosopher problem uses Zephyr semaphores to represent the
//! forks.  Each philosopher dines as per the algorithm a number of times, and when the are all
//! finished, the test is considered successful.  Deadlock will result in the primary thread not
//! completing.
//!
//! Notably, this uses Rc and RefCell along with spawn_local to demonstrate that multiple async
//! tasks run on the same worker do not need Send.  It is just important that write operations on
//! the RefCell do not `.await` or a panic is likely.
