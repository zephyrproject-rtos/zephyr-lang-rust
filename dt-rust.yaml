# Description of how to augment the devicetree for Rust.
#
# Each entry describes an augmentation that will be added to matching nodes in the device tree.
# The full syntax is described (indirectly) in `zephyr-build/src/devicetree/config.rs`.

# Gpio controllers match for every node that has a `gpio-controller` property.  This is one of the
# few instances were we can actually just match on a property.
