//! # Zephyr Kernel Objects
//!
//! Zephyr has a concept of a 'kernel object' that is handled a bit magically.  In kernel mode
//! threads, these are just pointers to the data structures that Zephyr uses to manage that item.
//! In userspace, they are still pointers, but those data structures aren't accessible to the
//! thread.  When making syscalls, the kernel validates that the objects are both valid kernel
//! objects and that the are supposed to be accessible to this thread.
//!
//! In many Zephyr apps, the kernel objects in the app are defined as static, using special macros.
//! These macros make sure that the objects get registered so that they are accessible to userspace
//! (at least after that access is granted).
//!
//! There are also kernel objects that are synthesized as part of the build.  Most notably, there
//! are ones generated by the device tree.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! Zephyr has traditionally not focused on safety.  Early versions of project goals, in fact,
//! emphasized performance and small code size as priorities over runtime checking of safety.  Over
//! the years, this focus has changed a bit, and Zephyr does contain some additional checking, some
//! of which is optional.
//!
//! Zephyr is still constrained at compile time to checks that can be performed with the limits
//! of the C language.  With Rust, we have a much greater ability to enforce many aspects of safety
//! at compile time.  However, there is some complexity to doing this at the interface between the C
//! world and Rust.
//!
//! There are two types of kernel objects we deal with.  There are kernel objects that are allocated
//! by C code (often auto-generated) that should be accessible to Rust.  These are mostly `struct
//! device` values, and will be handled in a devices module.  The other type are objects that
//! application code wishes to declare statically, and use from Rust code.  That is the
//! responsibility of this module.  (There will also be support for more dynamic management of
//! kernel objects, but this will be handled later).
//!
//! Static kernel objects in Zephyr are declared as C top-level variables (where the keyword static
//! means something different).  It is the responsibility of the calling code to initialize these
//! items, make sure they are only initialized once, and to ensure that sharing of the object is
//! handled properly.  All of these are concerns we can handle in Rust.
//!
//! To handle initialization, we pair each kernel object with a single atomic value, whose zero
//! value indicates [`KOBJ_UNINITIALIZED`].  There are a few instances of values that can be placed
//! into uninitialized memory in a C declaration that will need to be zero initialized as a Rust
//! static.  The case of thread stacks is handled as a special case, where the initialization
//! tracking is kept separate so that the stack can still be placed in initialized memory.
//!
//! This state goes through two more values as the item is initialized, one indicating the
//! initialization is happening, and another indicating it has finished.
//!
//! For each kernel object, there will be two types.  One, having a name of the form StaticThing,
//! and the other having the form Thing.  The StaticThing will be used in a static declaration.
//! There is a [`kobj_define!`] macro that matches declarations of these values and adds the
//! necessary linker declarations to place these in the correct linker sections.  This is the
//! equivalent of the set of macros in C, such as `K_SEM_DEFINE`.
//!
//! This StaticThing will have a single method [`init_once`] which accepts a single argument of a
//! type defined by the object.  For most objects, it will just be an empty tuple `()`, but it can
//! be whatever initializer is needed for that type by Zephyr.  Semaphores, for example, take the
//! initial value and the limit.  Threads take as an initializer the stack to be used.
//!
//! This `init_once` will initialize the Zephyr object and return the `Thing` item that will have
//! the methods on it to use the object.  Attributes such as `Sync`, and `Clone` will be defined
//! appropriately so as to match the semantics of the underlying Zephyr kernel object.  Generally
//! this `Thing` type will simply be a container for a direct pointer, and thus using and storing
//! these will have the same characteristics as it would from C.
//!
//! Rust has numerous strict rules about mutable references, namely that it is not safe to have more
//! than one mutable reference.  The language does allow multiple `*mut ktype` references, and their
//! safety depends on the semantics of what is pointed to.  In the case of Zephyr, some of these are
//! intentionally thread safe (for example, things like `k_sem` which have the purpose of
//! synchronizing between threads).  Others are not, and that is mirrored in Rust by whether or not
//! `Clone` and/or `Sync` are implemented.  Please see the documentation of individual entities for
//! details for that object.
//!
//! In general, methods on `Thing` will require `&mut self` if there is any state to manage.  Those
//! that are built around synchronization primitives, however, will generally use `&self`.  In
//! general, objects that implement `Clone` will use `&self` because there would be no benefit to
//! mutable self when the object could be cloned.
