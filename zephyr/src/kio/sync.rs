//! Synchronization mechanisms that work with async.
//!
//! Notably, Zephyr's `k_mutex` type isn't supported as a type that can be waited for
//! asynchronously.
//!
//! The main problem with `k_mutex` (meaning [`crate::sync::Mutex`]) is that the `lock` operation
//! can block, and since multiple tasks may be scheduled for the same work queue, the system can
//! deadlock, as the scheduler may not run to allow the task that actually holds the mutex to run.
//!
//! As an initial stopgap. We provide a [`Mutex`] type that is usable within an async context.  We
//! do not currently implement an associated `Condvar`.
//!
//! Note that using Semaphores for locking means that this mechanism doesn't handle priority
//! inversion issues.  Be careful with workers that run at different priorities.

// Use the same error types from the regular sync version.
