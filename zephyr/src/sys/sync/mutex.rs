//! Zephyr `k_mutex` wrapper.

//! This module implements a thing wrapper around the `k_mutex` type in Zephyr.  It works with the
//! kernel [`object`] system, to allow the mutexes to be defined statically.

//! [`object`]: crate::object

/// A Zephyr `k_mutux` usable from safe Rust code.
///
/// This merely wraps a pointer to the kernel object.  It implements clone, send and sync as it is
/// safe to have multiple instances of these, as well as use them across multiple threads.
///
/// Note that these are Safe in the sense that memory safety is guaranteed.  Attempts to
/// recursively lock, or incorrect nesting can easily result in deadlock.
///
/// Safety: Typically, the Mutex type in Rust does not implement Clone, and must be shared between
/// threads using Arc.  However, these sys Mutexes are wrappers around static kernel objects, and
/// Drop doesn't make sense for them.  In addition, Arc requires alloc, and one possible place to
/// make use of the sys Mutex is to be able to do so in an environment without alloc.
///
/// This mutex type of only of limited use to application programs.  It can be used as a simple
/// binary semaphore, although it has strict semantics, requiring the release to be called by the
/// same thread that called lock.  It can be used to protect data that Rust itself is either not
/// managing, or is managing in an unsafe way.
///
/// For a Mutex type that is useful in a Rust type of manner, please see the regular [`sync::Mutex`]
/// type.
