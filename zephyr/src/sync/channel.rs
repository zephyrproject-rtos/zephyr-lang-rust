//! Close-to-Zephyr channels
//!
//! This module attempts to provide a mechanism as close as possible to `crossbeam-channel` as we
//! can get, directly using Zephyr primitives.
//!
//! The channels are built around `k_queue` in Zephyr.  As is the case with most Zephyr types,
//! these are typically statically allocated.  Similar to the other close-to-zephyr primitives,
//! this means that there is a constructor that can directly take one of these primitives.
//!
//! In other words, `zephyr::sys::Queue` is a Rust friendly implementation of `k_queue` in Zephyr.
//! This module provides `Sender` and `Receiver`, which can be cloned and behave as if they had an
//! internal `Arc` inside them, but without the overhead of an actual Arc.
//!
//! ## IRQ safety
//!
//! These channels are usable from IRQ context on Zephyr in very limited situations.  Notably, all
//! of the following must be true:
//! - The channel has been created with `bounded()`, which pre-allocates all of the messages.
//! - If the type `T` has a Drop implementation, this implementation can be called from IRQ context.
//! - Only `try_send` or `try_recv` are used on the channel.
//!
//! The requirement for Drop is only strictly true if the IRQ handler calls `try_recv` and drops
//! received message.  If the message is *always* sent over another channel or otherwise not
//! dropped, it *might* be safe to use these messages.
//!
//! ## Dropping of Sender/Receiver
//!
//! Crossbeam channels support detecting when all senders or all receivers have been dropped on a
//! channel, which will cause the handles on the other end to error, including waking up current
//! threads waiting on those channels.
//!
//! At this time, this isn't implementable in Zephyr, as there is no API to wake up all threads
//! blocked on a given `k_queue`.  As such, this scenario is not supported.  What actually happens
//! is that when all senders or receivers on a channel are dropped, operations on the other end of
//! the channel may just block (or queue forever with unbounded queues).  If all handles (both
//! sender and receiver) are dropped, the last drop will cause a panic.  It maybe be better to just
//! leak the entire channel, as any data associated with the channels would be leaked at this point,
//! including the underlying Zephyr `k_queue`.  Until APIs are added to Zephyr to allow the channel
//! information to be safely freed, these can't actually be freed.
