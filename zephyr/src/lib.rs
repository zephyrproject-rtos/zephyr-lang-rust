//! Zephyr application support for Rust
//!
//! This crates provides the core functionality for applications written in Rust that run on top of
//! Zephyr.  The goal is to bridge the two worlds.  The functionality provided here shouldn't be too
//! distant from how Zephyr does things.  But, it should be "rusty" enough that Rust developers feel
//! comfortable using it.
//!
//! Some functionality:
//!
//! - [`time`]: The time module provides a [`Instant`] and [`Duration`] type that are similar to those
//!   in `std`, but are tailored for embedded systems.  These are bridged through traits, so that most
//!   API calls that offer a timeout will accept either an `Instant` or a `Duration`.
//! - [`sync`]: This crate provides various synchronization primitives that can be used to coordinate
//!   between threads.  These include
//!   - [`sync::atomic`]: Provides the same functionality as [`std::sync::atomic`], but on targets
//!     with limited synchronization primtives, re-exports features from the 'portable-atomic'
//!     crate, which can emulate atomics using critical sections.
//!   - [`sync::channel`]: Channel based synchronization built around the `k_queue` channels
//!     provided by Zephyr.  This provides both `alloc`-based unbounded channels, and bounded
//!     channels that pre-allocate.
//!   - [`sync::Mutex`]/[`sync::Condvar`]: `std`-style Mutexes and condition variables, where the
//!     Mutex protects some piece of data using Rust's features.
//!   - [`sync::SpinMutex`]: A Mutex that protects a piece of data, but does so using a spinlock.
//!     This is useful where data needs to be used exclusively, but without other types of
//!     synchronization.
//!   - [`sync::Arc`]: Atomic reference counted pointers.  Mostly like [`std::sync::Arc`] but supports
//!     all targets that support Rust on Zephyr.
//! - [`sys`]: More direct interfaces to Zephyr's primitives.  Most of the operations in `sync` are
//!   built on these.  These interfaces are 'safe', as in they can be used without the `unsafe`
//!   keyword, but the interfaces in `sync` are much more useful from Rust programs.  Although most
//!   things here won\t typically be needed, two standout:
//!   - [`sys::thread`]: A fairly direct, but safe, interface to create Zephyr threads.  At this
//!     point, this is the primary way to create threads in Rust code (see also [`work`] which
//!     supports multiple contexts using Zephyr's work queues.
//!   - [`sys::sync::Semaphore`]: The primitive Semaphore type from Zephyr.  This is the one lower
//!     level operation that is still quite useful in regular code.
//! - [`timer`]: Rust interfaces to Zephyr timers.  These timers can be used either by registering a
//!   callback, or polled or waited for for an elapsed time.
//! - [`work`]: Zephyr work queues for Rust.  The [`define_work_queue`] macro and resulting
//!   [`work::WorkQueue`] allow creation of Zephyr work queues to be used from Rust.  The
//!   [`work::Work`] item had an action that will be invoked by the work queue, and can be manually
//!   submitted when needed.
//! - [`logging`]: A logging backend for Rust on Zephyr.  This will log to either `printk` or
//!   through Zephyr's logging framework.
//!
//! [`Instant`]: time::Instant
//! [`Duration`]: time::Duration
//! [`std::sync::atomic`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/
//! [`std::sync::Arc`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html
//!
//! In addition to the above, the [`kconfig`] and [`devicetree`] provide a reflection of the kconfig
//! settings and device tree that were used for a specific build.  As such, the documentation
//! provided online is not likely to be that useful, and for these, it is best to generate the
//! documentation for a specific build:
//! ```bash
//! $ west rustdoc
//! ```
//!
//! Note, however, that the `kconfig` module only provides Kconfig **values**, and doesn't provide a
//! mechanmism to base conditional compilation.  For that, please see the
//! [zephyr-build](../../std/zephyr_build/index.html) crate, which provides routines that can be
//! called from a `build.rs` file to make these settings available.
